-    Open Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.
-     Go to **itunes.com/restore-tones**
-     Sign in with your Apple ID.
-     Tap Restore. You'll see a message that reads: "This may take a while. You can continue to use this device while we prepare your tones. You will be sent a push notification when they are ready to download."
-     **Tap Done**.
-     When you receive the notification on your device, tap Download, or, if you receive the notification on your lock screen, swipe to download.* All of your tones will download, including any that are explicit.
-     Check to make sure that your tones are now on your device:
-     Ringtones: Tap Settings > Sounds > Ringtone.
-     Alert tones: Tap Settings > Sounds > Text Tone (or any other alert listed).
-     If you assigned purchased tones to your contacts, these will also be restored.
