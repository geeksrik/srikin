So if your browser is loading pages slowly, here is a fix that might help

- Run Windows Command Prompt as administrator 
- (type 'cmd' in the Start menu search box, right click 'Run as administrator) 
- then type in '**netsh int ip reset**', pressed enter 
- Restart PC

Browsers are loading pages really quickly again.
